Rohit has very good problem solving skills.He always scores highest marks in Mathematics.</br>
He challenged his friends to solve a problem.</br>

He has given a sequence consisting of N non negative integers.He asks to find the number of different combinations of (a,b,c,d) by selecting values of a,b,c,d from the given sequence which satisfies the following equation:</br>

d=sqrt(a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>) </br>

## INPUT:
First line contains N - number of integers </br>
Second line contains sequence of N integers </br>.

## OUTPUT:
Number of possible combinations of (a,b,c,d) </br>

## CONSTRAINTS: </br>
1<= N <=1000 </br>
0<= a,b,c,d <=100000 </br>

## SAMPLE TESTCASE:

### INPUT: </br>
4 </br>
9 4 7 7 </br>

### OUTPUT: </br>
3 </br>

### EXPLANATION: </br>
Different combinations of (a,b,c,d) are (4,4,7,9),(4,7,4,9),(7,4,4,9).
